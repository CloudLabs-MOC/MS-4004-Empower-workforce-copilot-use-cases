# Exercise 2, Task 4: Use the Researcher agent to gather employee relocation insights

## Scenario

As part of your relocation to the Adatum office in Fargo, North Dakota, you want to explore what it’s like to live in Fargo and nearby communities in both North Dakota and Minnesota. You plan to use this information to help decide where your family settles. Key considerations include quality of life, housing options, commute times, recreational opportunities, community amenities, and access to strong educational programs for your children.

You then ask Researcher to analyze the cities in which these communities are located and provide a ranking of the top areas to consider based on a combination of these factors.

## Lab Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will use the Researcher agent to analyze relocation options around Fargo, North Dakota, and evaluate communities based on quality of life, affordability, family amenities, education, and commute considerations. You will also research and compare local high schools, then combine both analyses to identify the most suitable communities for families. The resulting reports will support informed relocation and lifestyle decisions.

1. In the **Researcher** prompt box, enter the provided prompt.

   ```
   Create a report about public and private high schools in Fargo and the surrounding communities within a 40-mile radius. Use the most recent data available. Rank every school, treating all criteria equally in ranking. Summarize the findings in a table for easy comparison.

   ```
   
6. Review Researcher’s analysis of your request. If everything looks OK, tell it to **Go ahead**.

1. In the **Researcher** prompt box, enter the provided prompt.

    ```
    Create a table that compares the top five ranked cities from your community analysis with the top five ranked schools from your school analysis.
    
    Include the following columns:
    - City name
    - School name
    - City ranking
    - School ranking
    - Key highlights (affordability, amenities, academic strengths)
    ```

8. Review the results. As this task showed, Researcher can take even a short prompt and deliver a thorough, structured analysis using up‑to‑date web data. You can use this same capability to explore, compare, and evaluate almost any topic where research, comparison, or decision support is needed.
