# Module 10- Empower Workforce Copilot - Legal

## Estimated duration: 4 hours

### Lab Overview

In this module, we'll create prompts for Microsoft 365 Copilot that reference files. First, let’s upload all required files to OneDrive to ensure they're accessible throughout the lab.

# Introduction 

For Legal professionals, precision, clarity, and compliance are non-negotiable. Whether drafting contracts, reviewing case materials, or advising on regulatory matters, the ability to work efficiently while maintaining legal accuracy is essential.

This module introduces Microsoft 365 Copilot as a transformative tool for Legal professionals. It can help streamline document creation, accelerate legal research, and manage large volumes of information across the Microsoft 365 suite.

In a field where time is critical and detail is everything, Copilot becomes an intelligent partner. It helps Legal teams reduce time spent on repetitive tasks, organize complex case data, and maintain a high standard of quality and compliance in every document. Whether you're reviewing contracts in Word, tracking case timelines in Excel, collaborating with internal teams in Teams, or preparing briefs in PowerPoint, Copilot can enhance your productivity and precision.

This module equips Legal professionals with the tools to use Copilot effectively in their day-to-day work. As a Legal expert, your ability to utilize Microsoft 365 Copilot is essential for:

- **Drafting legal documents**. Copilot can help you quickly generate or revise all sorts of legal documents, such as contracts, non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), and internal policies. For example, it can propose standard language, summarize long clauses, or adjust tone based on the audience.

- **Reviewing and analyzing content**. Copilot supports efficient legal review. For example, it can compare multiple versions of a contract, highlight key differences, and suggest areas that need further attention.

- **Managing legal workflows**. Copilot helps keep tasks and timelines organized. For example, it can track deadlines, generate action lists from meeting notes, and summarize case-related correspondence.

- **Enhancing research and compliance**. Copilot accelerates the process of finding relevant legal references or summarizing past decisions. For example, it can scan and extract key information from documents, emails, and internal files.

This training module is built around realistic, scenario‑driven exercises that reflect the responsibilities of modern Legal teams. These exercises mirror the daily work of Legal professionals—analyzing regulations, assessing risk, drafting guidance, and coordinating cross‑functional compliance efforts. Copilot strengthens these essential functions by accelerating research, improving clarity, and ensuring that legal information is consistent, defensible, and ready for action.

### Copilot prompting

One of the primary keys to effectively using Copilot is the quality of your Copilot prompts. A good Copilot prompt is built around the following four key elements that make your request clear, actionable, and tailored for the best results:

- **Goal**. Clearly state what you want Copilot to do. For example: “Generate three to five bullet points summarizing the latest project updates.”

- **Context**. Provide background information so Copilot understands why you need this request and who or what is involved. For example: “Prepare these bullet points for a meeting with Client X about their ‘Phase 3+’ brand campaign.”

- **Sources**. Specify where Copilot should look for information (documents, emails, Teams chats, and so on). For example: “Focus on emails and Teams chats since June.”

- **Expectations**. Define how you want the response delivered—tone, style, or level of detail. For example: “Use simple language so I can get up to speed quickly” or “Explain it as if I were a pirate.”


Keep these four elements front and center as you practice creating prompts—they’re the foundation for getting clear, accurate, and useful results from Copilot. Implementing these elements as you write prompts in these exercises can build real-world skills, so writing effective prompts becomes second nature.
